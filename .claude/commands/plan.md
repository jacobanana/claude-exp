description: Create technical implementation plan from business specification and technical approach
---

You are an expert Software Architect and Technical Lead responsible for creating detailed implementation plans. Your task is to analyze a business specification and proposed technical approach, then create a comprehensive, phase-based implementation plan that follows TDD principles.

## Instructions:

1. **Read the Specification First**: Always start by reading the SPEC document from `specs/SPEC-{SPEC_NUMBER}-{SPEC_NAME}.md`
2. **Validate Completeness**: Ensure NO "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" tags remain in the spec - stop planning if any exist
3. **Analyze Technical Approach**: Research and validate the proposed technical choices
4. **Question Risky Decisions**: Challenge incompatible or risky technology choices
5. **Enforce TDD**: Structure plan with Environment → Tests → Implementation flow
6. **Create Clear Tasks**: Each task must be unambiguous and complete
7. **Highlight Dependencies**: Show task relationships and parallel work opportunities
8. **Mark Ambiguity**: Use "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" for unclear tasks

## Validation Checklist:

Before planning, verify:
- [ ] SPEC document exists and is readable
- [ ] No "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" tags in the spec
- [ ] All functional requirements are clear
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios are complete
- [ ] Technical approach is provided in the input

**IMPORTANT: If validation fails, stop and request clarification.**

## Technical Analysis Framework:

### 1. **Specification Review**
   - **Requirements Coverage**: Map each FR-xxx to implementation tasks
   - **Acceptance Scenarios**: Ensure each Given-When-Then is testable
   - **Success Criteria**: Validate measurability in technical context
   - **Missing Elements**: Identify gaps between spec and technical needs

### 2. **Technology Validation**
   - **Compatibility Check**: Verify proposed technologies work together
   - **Risk Assessment**: Identify technical risks and alternatives
   - **Architecture Fit**: Ensure choices align with system architecture
   - **Performance Impact**: Consider scalability and performance implications
   - **Team Capability**: Assess if team has required expertise

### 3. **TDD Structure Enforcement**
   - **Environment Setup**: Infrastructure, dependencies, tooling
   - **Test Framework**: Unit tests, integration tests, acceptance tests
   - **Implementation Order**: Tests before code, Red-Green-Refactor cycle
   - **Verification Strategy**: How to validate each acceptance scenario

## Planning Framework:

### Phase 0: **Environment & Setup**
**Dependencies**: None
**Parallel Work**: All tasks in this phase can run in parallel

- **ENV-001**: [Specific environment setup task]
- **ENV-002**: [Specific tooling setup task]
- **ENV-003**: [Specific dependency installation task]

### Phase 1: **Initial Test Structure**
**Dependencies**: Phase 0 complete
**TDD Rule**: Create failing tests for core structure only

- **TEST-001**: Write failing tests for [core structure/interfaces]
  - **Covers**: Basic structure for FR-xxx
  - **Definition**: Write tests that define interfaces and basic structure
  - **Expected Result**: Tests MUST fail (Red phase)
- **IMPL-001**: Implement minimal structure to make Phase 1 tests pass
  - **Covers**: Basic scaffolding for FR-xxx
  - **Definition**: Create minimal code to make TEST-001 pass (Green phase)
  - **Expected Result**: Phase 1 tests pass, no additional functionality

### Phase 2: **Feature Implementation (TDD Cycles)**
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 complete
**TDD Rule**: Each task follows strict Red-Green-Refactor cycle

For each functional requirement, create separate TDD cycles:

**TDD Cycle 2A: [First Feature]**
- **TEST-2A1**: Write failing test for [specific feature behavior]
  - **Covers**: FR-xxx specific scenario
  - **Definition**: Write test that validates [specific behavior]
  - **Validation**: Run test - MUST fail
- **IMPL-2A1**: Implement [specific feature] to make TEST-2A1 pass
  - **Prerequisites**: TEST-2A1 is failing
  - **Definition**: Write minimal code to make TEST-2A1 pass
  - **Validation**: Run TEST-2A1 - MUST pass, all other tests still pass
- **REFACTOR-2A1**: Refactor [specific feature] if needed
  - **Prerequisites**: TEST-2A1 passing
  - **Definition**: Improve code quality without changing behavior
  - **Validation**: All tests still pass after refactoring

**TDD Cycle 2B: [Second Feature]**
- **TEST-2B1**: Write failing test for [next feature behavior]
  - **Covers**: FR-xxx specific scenario
  - **Prerequisites**: TDD Cycle 2A complete
  - **Validation**: Run test - MUST fail, all previous tests still pass
- **IMPL-2B1**: Implement [next feature] to make TEST-2B1 pass
  - **Prerequisites**: TEST-2B1 is failing
  - **Validation**: Run all tests - TEST-2B1 and all previous tests MUST pass
- **REFACTOR-2B1**: Refactor if needed
  - **Validation**: All tests still pass

**Continue pattern for each functional requirement...**

### Phase 3: **Integration Testing (TDD Cycles)**
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 complete

**TDD Cycle 3A: Integration Tests**
- **TEST-3A1**: Write failing integration tests
  - **Covers**: End-to-end acceptance scenarios
  - **Definition**: Write tests that validate complete user workflows
  - **Validation**: Tests MUST fail initially
- **IMPL-3A1**: Implement integration logic to make tests pass
  - **Prerequisites**: TEST-3A1 failing
  - **Validation**: All tests (unit + integration) pass

### Phase 4: **Acceptance Validation**
**Dependencies**: Phase 3 complete

- **VAL-001**: Validate each Given-When-Then scenario
  - **Method**: Run automated tests that mirror acceptance criteria
  - **Expected**: All acceptance scenarios pass

## Task Definition Standards:

Each task must include:
- **Task ID**: Unique identifier (ENV-xxx, TEST-xxx, IMPL-xxx, REFACTOR-xxx, VAL-xxx)
- **Covers**: Which FR-xxx or acceptance scenario it addresses
- **Dependencies**: What must be complete before starting
- **Prerequisites**: Specific conditions that must be met (e.g., "TEST-2A1 is failing")
- **Definition**: Clear, specific description of what to do
- **Validation**: How to verify the task is complete (including test states)
- **Expected Result**: Explicit expectation (tests fail, tests pass, etc.)

## TDD Enforcement Rules:

**CRITICAL**: Every implementation task must follow this exact sequence:

1. **Write Failing Test**: 
   - Task: TEST-xxx
   - Validation: Run test - MUST return failure/red
   - Cannot proceed until test fails

2. **Implement Minimal Code**:
   - Task: IMPL-xxx  
   - Prerequisites: TEST-xxx is failing
   - Validation: Run TEST-xxx - MUST pass, all previous tests still pass
   - Write ONLY enough code to make the failing test pass

3. **Refactor if Needed**:
   - Task: REFACTOR-xxx (optional)
   - Prerequisites: All tests passing
   - Validation: All tests still pass after refactoring

**RED-GREEN-REFACTOR CYCLE MUST BE EXPLICIT IN EVERY TASK**

## Questions to Address:

For any technical choices, consider:
- **Why this technology?** Is it the right fit for the requirements?
- **What are the alternatives?** Are there better options?
- **What are the risks?** What could go wrong?
- **Does the team know this?** Is additional learning required?
- **How does this scale?** Will it handle expected load?
- **How do we test this?** Is it easily testable?

## Output Format:

Save the result as `specs/PLAN-{SPEC_NUMBER}-{SPEC_NAME}.md` in the root directory.

Structure the plan as:
```markdown
# Implementation Plan: [SPEC_NAME]

## Progress Tracking
**Instructions for Claude Code**: Before starting any task, you MUST:
1. Verify all prerequisites are marked as ✅ COMPLETE
2. Update task status to 🔄 IN PROGRESS when starting
3. Update task status to ✅ COMPLETE when finished
4. Validate all task requirements before marking complete

## Critical Rules:

- **Stop if spec has "NEEDS CLARIFICATION"** - cannot plan incomplete requirements
- **Every FR-xxx must map to specific tasks** - no requirements left unaddressed
- **Every acceptance scenario must be testable** - clear test strategy for each
- **TDD is mandatory** - tests come before implementation always
- **Tasks must be crystal clear** - no room for interpretation
- **Mark unclear tasks** - use "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" when task scope is ambiguous
- **Prerequisite Validation Required** - Claude Code must verify prerequisites before starting tasks
- **Progress Tracking Mandatory** - All task statuses must be updated as work progresses
- **Checklist Format Required** - All tasks must be trackable with checkbox format

## Workflow Instructions for Claude Code:

When implementing this plan, you MUST follow these rules:

1. **Before Starting Any Task:**
   - Check that ALL prerequisites are marked ✅ COMPLETE
   - If prerequisites are not complete, mark task as ❌ BLOCKED
   - Update task status to 🔄 IN PROGRESS before beginning work

2. **During Task Execution:**
   - Follow the exact task definition provided
   - Perform the validation steps specified
   - Do not deviate from the TDD cycle requirements

3. **After Completing Task:**
   - Verify all validation criteria are met
   - Update task status to ✅ COMPLETE
   - Update phase status if all phase tasks are complete
   - Update progress summary counters

4. **If Task Cannot Be Completed:**
   - Mark status as ❌ BLOCKED
   - Document the blocking issue
   - Do not proceed to dependent tasks

5. **Progress Updates Required:**
   - Update the plan file after every task completion
   - Maintain accurate progress summary
   - Keep status indicators current

Remember: This plan will be used by developers (human or AI) to implement the feature. Every task must be actionable and unambiguous, with clear progress tracking.
