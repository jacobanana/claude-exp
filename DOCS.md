- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between business specs, technical plans, and implementation

### Data Models

**Document-Driven Data Models**
This repository uses structured documents as its primary data model:

**Specification Data Model** (`spec.md:38-82`):
- **User Story**: As a/I want to/So that structure
- **Problem & Context**: User problem, current situation, importance
- **Functional Requirements**: FR-xxx numbered requirements
- **Acceptance Scenarios**: Given-When-Then format
- **Success Criteria**: User success and business success metrics
- **Questions & Clarifications**: Research needs and assumptions

**Implementation Plan Data Model** (`plan.md:50-84`):
- **Phases**: Environment → Tests → Implementation → Integration
- **Tasks**: Structured with ID, covers, dependencies, definition, acceptance
- **Dependencies**: Clear task relationships and parallel work identification
- **Risk Assessment**: Technical risks and mitigation strategies

**Claude Command Configuration**:
- Command metadata (description, variables)
- Structured prompts and instructions
- Output format specifications

### Code Structure

**Directory Organization:**
- `.claude/commands/`: Custom Claude Code command definitions
  - `docs.md`: Comprehensive codebase analysis command (`docs.md:1-112`)
  - `spec.md`: Product specification generation command (`spec.md:1-83`)
  - `plan.md`: Technical implementation planning command (`plan.md:1-142`)
- `specs/`: Product specifications and technical plans
  - Business specifications (SPEC-xxx-name.md format)
  - Implementation plans (PLAN-xxx-name.md format)
- Root level: Project infrastructure and documentation

**Key Components:**

1. **Product Development Workflow Commands**:
   - **Spec Command** (`spec.md:5-82`): Transforms natural language into structured business specifications
   - **Plan Command** (`plan.md:5-142`): Creates TDD-based implementation plans from specifications
   - **Docs Command** (`docs.md:1-112`): Generates comprehensive codebase analysis

2. **Claude Command Deployer Specification** (`SPEC-001:1-62`):
   - Primary product: Python CLI tool for deploying .claude commands
   - 7 functional requirements covering deployment, updates, and GitHub integration
   - 5 acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format

3. **Implementation Plan** (`PLAN-001:1-147`):
   - 4-phase TDD approach: Environment → Tests → Implementation → Integration
   - 14 hours estimated development time
   - Python + UV + Click + pytest technology stack

### Design Patterns

**Identified Patterns:**

1. **Command Pattern**: All three Claude commands (`docs`, `spec`, `plan`) extend functionality through structured command definitions
2. **Template Method Pattern**: Each command provides a structured framework with defined steps:
   - `spec.md`: Analysis Framework → User Story → Problem & Context → Requirements → Scenarios
   - `plan.md`: Validation → Technical Analysis → Phase Planning → Risk Assessment
   - `docs.md`: Business Summary → Technology Stack → Technical Deep Dive → Recommendations

3. **Builder Pattern**: The specification and planning process builds complex documents through incremental, structured steps
4. **Strategy Pattern**: Different commands handle different aspects of product development (requirements, planning, documentation)
5. **Factory Pattern**: Commands generate standardized document formats (SPEC-xxx.md, PLAN-xxx.md, DOCS.md)
6. **Chain of Responsibility**: spec → plan → implementation workflow where each stage depends on the previous
7. **Configuration Pattern**: Separation of command logic from execution environment through .claude configuration

### Dependencies

**Internal Dependencies:**
```
spec.md → plan.md → implementation
     ↓        ↓            ↓
SPEC-001 → PLAN-001 → (future specli implementation)
     ↑
docs.md (analyzes entire codebase)
```

**Workflow Dependencies:**
- `plan.md` requires completed `SPEC-xxx.md` file (validates no "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" tags)
- Implementation phase requires completed `PLAN-xxx.md` file
- `docs.md` can run independently to analyze current state

**External Dependencies:**
- **Claude Code CLI**: Primary dependency for command execution
- **Git**: For version control and repository operations
- **GitHub CLI**: Required by specli for repository authentication (FR-007)
- **Python ecosystem**: UV package manager, pytest, Click framework
- **pipx**: For global CLI tool installation
- **Markdown processors**: For documentation rendering

**Dependency Analysis:**
- **Moderate Coupling**: Structured workflow dependencies between commands
- **High Cohesion**: Each command has a single, well-defined purpose in the development lifecycle
- **Clean Interfaces**: Standardized document formats enable loose coupling between phases

### Security Considerations

**Current Security Posture:**
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Only configuration and documentation files
- **Sensitive Data Protection**:
  - `.claude/settings.local.json` properly gitignored
  - No credentials, keys, or sensitive information in tracked files
- **Safe Practices**: Uses standard markdown and configuration formats

**Planned Security (specli implementation):**
- **Authentication**: Delegates to GitHub CLI for secure repository access (`PLAN-001:line 149-155`)
- **File System Safety**: Implementation plan includes permission validation and backup creation
- **Input Validation**: Error handling for invalid repository access and missing .claude folders
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Tool only accesses specified target repositories

### Performance Considerations

**Current Performance Characteristics:**
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource requirements for command execution
- **Fast Execution**: Simple file-based operations and document generation
- **Scalable**: Can easily accommodate additional commands and specifications

**Planned Performance (specli):**
- **Target Performance**: Deploy to target repository in under 30 seconds (`SPEC-001:line 37`)
- **Optimization Strategy**: UV package manager for fast dependency resolution
- **Scalability**: Support for multiple target repositories in single operation
- **Resource Efficiency**: Minimal dependencies (Click + required tools only)

### Error Handling

**Current Error Management:**
- Relies on Claude Code CLI's built-in error handling for command execution
- Document validation through structured templates and validation checkpoints
- Workflow validation: `plan.md` stops if specification contains "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" tags

**Planned Error Handling (specli):**
- **Comprehensive Error Messages**: Clear, user-friendly error descriptions for all failure scenarios (`PLAN-001:INT-001`)
- **Validation Strategy**: Check GitHub CLI installation, repository access, file permissions
- **Graceful Failures**: Handle network connectivity issues with retry logic
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Backup creation for safe rollback of failed operations

### Testing Strategy

**Current State:**
- **No Formal Tests**: Commands are currently in specification/planning phase
- **Manual Validation**: Relies on manual execution and verification of generated documents
- **Documentation-Based Testing**: Success measured by documentation quality and command execution
- **Workflow Testing**: Manual validation of spec → plan → implementation process

**Planned Testing Strategy (specli):**
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive TDD approach enforced by `plan.md` command
- **Testing Framework**: pytest with structured test phases (`PLAN-001:Phase 1`)
- **Test Types**:
  - **Unit Tests**: CLI commands, file operations, GitHub integration
  - **Integration Tests**: End-to-end command workflows
  - **Acceptance Tests**: Each Given-When-Then scenario from `SPEC-001`
- **Test Environment**: Temporary directories, mocked GitHub CLI calls, pytest fixtures

## Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**
- **Structured Development Process**: Complete spec → plan → implementation workflow
- **Comprehensive Command Framework**: Three specialized commands covering full development lifecycle
- **Clear Documentation Standards**: Consistent markdown formatting and structured templates
- **TDD Enforcement**: Planning command mandates test-driven development approach
- **Good Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between business requirements, technical planning, and implementation
- **Validation Gates**: Plan command validates specification completeness before proceeding
- **Professional Standards**: Follows industry best practices for requirement gathering and technical planning

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **Command Usage Examples**: Could benefit from examples of command execution and outputs
- **Automated Validation**: No automated testing of command template validation
- **Implementation Gap**: Specifications and plans exist but actual implementation (specli) not yet built
- **Command Iteration**: No versioning or evolution strategy for command templates

**Technical Debt:**
- **Minimal Current Debt**: Clean, well-structured command definitions
- **Future Debt Risk**: Implementation phase may introduce complexity not captured in current analysis
- **Documentation Maintenance**: As commands evolve, keeping documentation current will require discipline
