# SPEC-001: Claude Command Deployer

## User Story

**As a** developer using Claude Code commands across multiple repositories
**I want to** deploy and update my custom .claude commands to target repositories with a simple CLI tool
**So that** I can maintain consistency and share my Claude commands across projects without manual copying

## Problem & Context

**User Problem**: Developers create useful Claude Code commands but struggle to share and maintain them across multiple repositories, leading to manual copying, version drift, and inconsistent tooling.

**Current Situation**: Users manually copy .claude folders between repositories or recreate commands from scratch, making it difficult to keep commands updated and synchronized.

**Why This Matters**: Standardizing Claude commands across projects improves developer productivity and ensures consistent tooling workflows across an organization or personal projects.

## Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a CLI tool that can deploy .claude commands from a source repository to target repositories
- **FR-002**: System MUST be able to clone/copy .claude folder contents to target repositories
- **FR-003**: System MUST support updating existing .claude commands in target repositories
- **FR-004**: System MUST link to a GitHub repository as the source of truth for commands
- **FR-005**: System MUST be extremely lightweight with minimal dependencies
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to specify target repositories for deployment either as a CLI argument or when asked when running the tool
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle authentication for GitHub repository access using the Github CLI

## Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a source repository with .claude commands and a target repository, **When** I run the deploy command, **Then** the .claude folder is copied to the target repository
2. **Given** a target repository that already has .claude commands, **When** I run the update command, **Then** existing commands are updated with new versions from source
3. **Given** multiple target repositories specified, **When** I run the deploy command, **Then** commands are deployed to all specified repositories
4. **Given** the source repository is updated, **When** I run the update command on targets, **Then** all target repositories receive the latest command versions
5. **Given** invalid repository access or missing .claude folder, **When** I run the tool, **Then** I receive a clear error message explaining the issue

## Success Criteria

**User Success**: Developers can deploy and maintain Claude commands across multiple repositories in under 30 seconds with a single command

**Business Success**: Reduced time spent on manual command synchronization and improved consistency of Claude tooling across projects

## Questions & Clarifications

**User Research Needed**:
- How do users typically organize their target repositories (workspace, organization, list)?
- What's the preferred authentication method for GitHub access?
    Using the Github CLI
- Do users need selective command deployment or always full .claude folder sync?
    To keep things simple, it will be a full sync.

**Business Decisions Required**:
- Should this tool support other Git providers besides GitHub?
    Just github for now
- What's the installation/distribution method (npm, binary, script)?
    NPM

**Assumptions to Validate**:
- Users have GitHub repositories they want to deploy to
    Yes
- Source repository .claude folder structure is standardized
    Yes, 
- Users prefer command-line interface over GUI tool
    Yes
