# Refactor Spec — Main Module Separation of Concerns

## 1. User Story (Single, focused story)
- **As a** developer maintaining the specli codebase
- **I want to** have the main.py module refactored into focused, single-responsibility modules
- **So that** the codebase is more maintainable, testable, and follows clean architecture principles

## 2. Problem & Context
- **Developer Problem:** The main.py file contains 354 lines with mixed responsibilities including CLI command handling, business logic orchestration, error handling, and user interface concerns making it difficult to maintain and test individual components
- **Current Situation:** All command logic (deploy/update) is embedded directly in click command functions with extensive duplication of validation, error handling, and output formatting patterns
- **Why This Matters Now:** The file violates single responsibility principle and makes unit testing difficult, while code duplication increases maintenance burden as new commands are added

## 3. Refactoring Requirements (Must-haves only)
- **FR-001:** System MUST separate CLI command handlers from business logic operations
- **FR-002:** System MUST extract common validation and error handling patterns into reusable components
- **FR-003:** System MUST isolate user output formatting and messaging from core business operations
- **FR-004:** System MUST maintain identical CLI interface and all current command behaviors (deploy, update, version, help)
- **FR-005:** System MUST preserve all existing error messages and output formats exactly

## 4. Acceptance Scenarios (Given / When / Then)
1. **Given** the refactored codebase, **When** running `specli deploy <repo>` or `specli update` commands, **Then** all output messages and behavior are identical to current implementation
2. **Given** the refactored modules, **When** a developer needs to modify deployment or update logic, **Then** changes can be made in a single focused module without touching CLI or UI concerns
3. **Given** the separated components, **When** writing unit tests for business logic, **Then** tests can be written without mocking Click CLI framework
4. **Given** common patterns are extracted, **When** adding new commands, **Then** validation and error handling can be reused without duplication

## 5. Success Criteria
- **User Success:** CLI users experience no changes in behavior, output, or error messages
- **Business Success:** Developer velocity increases due to improved testability and reduced code duplication across command implementations

## 6. Scope Boundaries
- **In Scope:** main.py module refactoring, extracting command operations, validation patterns, and output formatting
- **Out of Scope:** Changes to existing modules (filesystem.py, github.py, config.py, backup.py), test modifications, CLI interface changes

## 7. Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Breaking existing CLI behavior during refactor → **Mitigation:** Preserve exact output messages and error handling patterns, run full test suite validation
- **Risk:** Over-engineering with unnecessary abstractions → **Mitigation:** Focus only on clear separation of concerns without adding complexity

## 8. Questions & Clarifications
- Should new modules follow existing naming conventions in the codebase? (Following existing snake_case module names like filesystem.py, github.py)
- Are there specific patterns for error message formatting that should be preserved? (Preserving exact "ERROR:" prefix and click.echo formatting patterns from main.py)
- Should the refactor introduce dependency injection patterns or keep current direct imports? (Keeping current direct import patterns to minimize change scope)
